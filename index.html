            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level interpreted programming language.
                JS is dynamic, and  weakly typed. It is one of the core languages
                used in the world wide web. Javascript enables interactive web
                pages and is used in nearly all web applications. All major browsers
                have a dedicated JS engine to execute it.

                JS is a functional language. It works with many different paradigms
                including object-oriented and prototype based. It has API's for
                working with text, arrays, dates, and regular expressions. JS itself
                does not have any networking, storage or graphics facilities but
                rely's on the host environment to that it's embedded on to provide
                those features.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape
                Communications. The language was inspired my Java, Scheme and self.
                In late 1995 Microsoft began work on Internet Explorer to compete
                with the other web browsers of the time. This caused netscape to
                merge with Sun to help compete against Microsoft. The name JavaScript
                was created as a marketing ploy with the huge hype behind the Java
                it was an easy way for them to get recognized even though the weren't
                technically companion languages.

                JavaScript continues to be one of the most hated Programming languages.
                Despite other companies, including Microsoft, Adobe, and Google's, many
                attempts to supplement Javascript it continues to thrive and has become
                the standard PL of the web. This is contributed to the fact that it was
                one of the first but also because it is open, standardized ans well suited
                for the web.
            </p>
            <h2>Documentation and Links</h2>
            <p>These websites have extensive tutorials and examples on how to program with Javascript!</p>

                 </ul>
            <h2>Translators/installation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no installation needed for Javascript, you can simply write scripts directly into html or in a
                    separate file. Separate Javascript files must be included in the meta data of your html pages
                    using script tags. For example: &lt;script src="myFile.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Simple programs with build/run steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The most basic Javascript example is the classic Hello world console.log()!
                    The Javascript looks like this: <span class="scriptExample">console.log("Hello World!");</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can run this piece of Javascript code on any browser that has Javascript enabled by simply making
                    a new Javascript file. You can name this what ever you'd like, for my example I named mine script.js.
                        Copy and paste the code from above in that file, then create an html file named index.html. In the HTML file simply add
                        a script by writing &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Now when you run that html file locally
                        in google chrome you can see the console log by right clicking and selecting Inspect. From here click on the
                        tab labeled Console and your message should be there.</p>
                    <p>- Check out the Console right now to see my message!</p> <br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Another basic example of Javascript is the Javascript Event. Here is an example called onClick();</p>
                    <p>Click this button to see what it does. <button onclick="alert('Hello there, this is an alert!')">Click me!</button></p>
                    <p>The code for my the button above looks like this: <span class="scriptExample">&lt;button onclick="alert('Hello, World!')"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;</span>
                    <p>The event only fires when a user clicks on the button. To build this, create a new html file and copy and paste the code from
                    above into that file. Open your new html file in a browser that has Javascript enabled and you should have a functioning alert
                    button!
                </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Language comparison</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Javascript vs. Java</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Both languages are object oriented, but Java is strongly typed compared to Javascript who is weakly typed.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Javascript only runs on the browser while Java runs on the server.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Java code needs to be compiled.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Javascript vs. HTML</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>HTML is used to create web pages while Javascript is used to make these web pages more dynamic.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Javascript can interact with the users input.</p></li>
                        <li><p>By definition, Javascript is a scripting language and HTML is a markup language.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Javascript vs. Jquery</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Jquery is an Application Programming Interface written with Javascript while Javascript is simply a programming language.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Jquery is used to minimize and simply your Javascript code.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Both Javascript and Jquery are used on the client side of applications.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Javascript vs. Python</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>In Javascript you don't need to specify the type of your variables making the language weakly typed. Python on the other hand is strongly typed similar to Java.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Python is able to use class-based Inheritance which is not something Javascript supports.</p></li>
                        <li><p>JavaScript can be used to run on frontend whereas python is on server side programming or backend.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Python is the coolest language ever!.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Javascript vs. Node.JS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Node.JS is used to create backend services, while we know Javascript is client side.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Node.JS runs on the V8 engine which is also runs Javascript in Google Chrome. The difference is that Node.JS is not a programming language, it's an environment that runs Javascript.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Node.js uses an event-driven and non-blocking I/O model which allows it to initiate two requests at the same time.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
